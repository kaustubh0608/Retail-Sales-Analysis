# Retail-Sales-Analysis
A complete analysis of sales for a retail business.


This repository contains analyses conducted to address business challenges for a superstore and an e-commerce client. The tasks involved performing exploratory data analysis (EDA) followed by identifying delivery issues, understanding seasonal sales trends, and strategizing geographic expansion.

Case 1: Delivery Insights
Performed EDA and analyzed customer feedback to:

Check if deliveries matched selected modes.
Verify if customer priority was addressed.
Measure delivery issues and their impact on returns.
Identify problem regions for delivery.

Case 3: Seasonal Sales Analysis
Conducted EDA and examined sales trends for summer and winter to identify products with seasonal fluctuations and recommend focus categories.

Case 4: Geographic Expansion
Analyzed profit trends across regions post-EDA to recommend areas for investment and business growth over the next two years.

This project applies data analytics techniques to derive actionable insights for business improvement.
